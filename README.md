# Timetable Generator

Converts my school's web timetable API response to .timetable file for the Class Timetable App.\
Currently live at my https://tennour.github.io/timetable-generator/ \
Also live at the current backend hoster: https://timetable-generator-qus9.onrender.com/

### Why is there a password?

Because I don't want everybody on the Internet to be able to download my school's timetables. That's also why the school's name isn't mentioned.

### Credits and Disclaimers

This code is not affiliated with the school or Class Timetable. \
I wrote all the code with AI, so I'm sorry if it breaks. \
If you have any problems email me at trophy_cuckoo_0d@icloud.com using your school email.

### How does it work?

The frontend (just one HTML and JS file contained in `docs`) is hosted on GitHub pages. It makes requests to the backend (the rest of the code). This is so I can change the backend provider without changing the app's link.
