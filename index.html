    <h1><code>.timetable</code> Generator for NBSC Manly Campus</h1>
    <p>
      Converts the school's web timetable to a <code>.timetable</code> file for
      the <a href="https://classtimetable.app/">Class Timetable App</a>.

      <strong>WARNING:</strong> Putting your school password into random
      websites is a <strong>very</strong> dangerous thing to do. I know
      <strong>nothing</strong> about password security, and I was assited in
      writing it by AI. The source code is on
      <a
        style="color: red"
        href="https://github.com/liam-llewellyn/timetable-generator"
        >GitHub</a
      >, but <strong>I</strong> wouldn't trust this website. However, I promise
      this code will only use your password to log into the school's website,
      and will not be stored. There is no central server, all code runs on your
      machine.
