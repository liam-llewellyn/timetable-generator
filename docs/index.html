  <h1>Timetable Generator</h1>
  <p>Converts the school's web timetable to a .timetable file for the <a href="https://classtimetable.app/">Class
      Timetable App</a>.</p>

  <h4>Why is there a password?</h4>
  <p>Because I don't want everybody on the Internet to be able to download our timetables. That's also why the school
    name isn't mentioned. Ask the person who gave you this link for the password. If you can't figure it out
    <a href="mailto:trophy_cuckoo_0d@icloud.com">email me</a> using your school email.
